Best practices?
---------------

This site is about things that have a large consensus in the MacAdmin Community. For example: 

* thin imaging is better than thick imaging (not always).
* Apple maintains only the last three major OS releases (wellâ€¦ we had a security update for 10.6.8 after 10.11 was released[#]_).

So yes, defining "best practice" is not that easy. Think of what you will tell to your apprentice.

Contributing docs
-----------------

We use `Github <https://github.com/Shufflepuck/MacAdminsDoc>`_ to manage the whole content. You should be familiar with `how to contribute on GitHub <https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/>`_. 
I personally use `TextMate <https://github.com/textmate/textmate>`_ to edit the `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ documents.

The easiest way for quick edits is to click on the "Edit on GitHub" on upper right of every page.
