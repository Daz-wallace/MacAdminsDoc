TextEdit
^^^^^^^^
Being free and available on every Mac, this is a no-brainer.

* Make sure you edit in text-only (CMD+SHIFT+T)
* Add it to your Dock for quick drag 'n drop
* in CLI, use `open -e [file]` to open in TextEdit

Sublime Text
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download for free `here <http://sublimetext.com>`_

* This is the preferred choice for a lots of developers
* Useful for highlighting
* `Add it to your Command Line <https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html>`_

TextMate
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download for free `here <https://github.com/textmate/textmate>`_
