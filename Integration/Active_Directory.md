On mobile computers, users don’t logout as often and are mostly on Wi-Fi which doesn’t have time to connect before unlocking the screensaver. As a result, kerberos tickets are rarely renewed. | Enterprise Connect or NoMAD handles the renewal of Kerberos tickets                                                                                                                                                                          |
| AD users can log in to any bound Mac & Shared use of Mac (eg. Lab computers) | As user identification and authentication resides on server, users can log in on any bound Mac. This is especially interesting for shared environments such as Labs                                                                                                                                | On mobile devices, this is getting harder as Portable Home Directories (syncing user home from file share) is no longer supported. The only possibility is to use network directories which are impractical in a mobile environment |
| User identification and computer usage traceability                          | Binding to AD ensures that each username and uid is used only once across the bound Mac computers                                                                                                                                                                                                  | MDM can better trace computer usage                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
